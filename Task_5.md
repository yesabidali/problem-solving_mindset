# Task 5: 
## Other Data Types, Lists, Tuples, and Dict

- List
- Tuples
- Dictonary

List : It stores multiple value of diffrent data types. List is mutable which mean we can do changes in list and it is ordered.

Tuples : It stores multiple value but tuples it immutable which means we can't change the tuple. Used when our data is fixed

Dictionaries : It stores values in a form of key value pair. We can create list, tuples, and dict inside the dictionary

### Practice

Create a list which store multiple learning topic

``` 
learning_topic = ['variables' , 'data_types' , 'control_flow', 'operators']
print(learning_topic)
```
Creating a tuple and dictionary which represent element of mini projects

```
elements = ('Topics', 'status' , 'progess' , 'feedback')
print(elements)
```

```
element_dict = {
    'Topic' : 'Variables',
    'statues' : 'Finished'
}
print(element_dict)
```
