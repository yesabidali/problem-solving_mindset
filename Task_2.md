# Task 2: Python Basic Syntax

## Objective  
Understand basic syntax, indentation, and comments (single-line `#` and multi-line `''' ... '''`).  

## Indentation  
Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a line. Python uses indentation to define blocks of code.  

```python
# This is a single-line comment (Use `#` to denote a single-line comment)
print("This refers to (#) syntax of the single-line comment")  # This prints the statement.

    # print("This will cause an error because it does not follow proper indentation")
```

```python
""" This is multi line comments 
You can it if you are writing in discribe
"""
print ("This follow right indentation")
```
